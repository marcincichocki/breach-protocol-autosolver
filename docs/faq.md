## Frequently Asked Questions

### Windows is telling me that this file is dangerous!

That's because installer is not signed. If you are willing to pay for code signing certificate, I can consider adding it.

### If code is not signed, how can I know this program is secure?

It's [open source](https://github.com/marcincichocki/breach-protocol-autosolver).

### How do I change default key bind?

1. go to the settings;
2. in _AutoSolver_ section click on key bind input;
3. press desired key combination;
4. confirm your choice with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### I'm playing on gamepad, is it possible to bind _BPA_ to it?

Yes, although not directly. You must use external tool like [AntiMicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro) for gamepad, or [X-Mouse Button Control](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/XMouseButtonControl.htm) for mouse. Simply bind gamepad/mouse to output _BPA_'s key bind. **Just make sure that selected gamepad/mouse bind does not interfere with Breach Protocol!**

### How to make it work on streaming services?

On _Windows_ use _AutoHotkey_ as engine, as _NirCmd_ can't send input to streaming services. On _Linux_ it should work out of the box.

### There are other tools like this. How this differs from the rest?

_BPA_ works on _Windows_, _Linux_, streaming services and on every supported language by Cyberpunk 2077.

### What about macOS version?

_macOS_ version is theoretically possible, but I can't commit to it because I don't have a mac to test it on.

> If you are interested in creating macOS distribution, open new issue in [github repository](https://github.com/marcincichocki/breach-protocol-autosolver).

### I would like to propose a feature request!
