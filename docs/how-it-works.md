## Why?

Breach protocol is nice, but tedious minigame in Cyberpunk 2077. It can appear a lot, and can get quickly annoying. _BPA_ was created to skip it if player so wish.

## How it works

_BPA_ takes screenshot, read data through optical character recognition, and simulate mouse or keyboard input.
